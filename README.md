## [1. RFM Customer Segmentation & Cohort Analysis Project](https://github.com/muhsinayaz/Capstone_Projects/tree/main/01-RFM%20Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Cohort%20Analysis%20Project)

Welcome to the "RFM Customer Segmentation and Cohort Analysis Project". It is the first project of the Graduation Project Series, which consists of 3 different projects with different scenarios.

This is a project where we learn what RFM is. And we looked at how to implement RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering. We have also enhanced our Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis capabilities. On the other hand, we created Cohort and Conducted Cohort Analysis.

## [2. Employee Loss Analysis Project](https://github.com/muhsinayaz/Capstone_Projects/tree/main/02-Churn%20Prediction_)


Welcome to the "Employee Loss Analysis Project". This is the second project in the Graduation Project Series, where you can create your own classification models for various business environments.

We also explored exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee loss dataset using matplotlib and seaborn, model building and evaluation using python scikit-learn and Tensorflow-Keras packages.

We applied classification techniques in Python. For this project, we used Scikit-Learn, which allows us to make successful predictions with Distance Based, Bagging, Boosting algorithms. On the other hand, Tensorflow-Keras was used for Deep Learning.

At the end of the project, we deployed our model using Streamlit.

## [3. Fraud Detection Project](https://github.com/muhsinayaz/Capstone_Projects/tree/main/03-Fraud%20Detection)


Welcome to the "Fraud Detection Project". This is the last project of the Capstone Series.

One of the challenges in this project is the lack of domain knowledge. So, without knowing what the column names are, we were only interested in their values. The other is that the class frequencies of the target variable are quite unbalanced.

We applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Neural Network algorithms and Unbalanced Data Techniques. In addition, the performances of models using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Yellowbrick were visualized in various ways.

At the end of the project, we shared our model on AWS using the Streamlit API.
